# Overview

<!-- .slide: data-background="grey" -->

> Mostly common sense

---

## Outline of talk

- Research is becoming more complex <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Reproducible research: big picture <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> Practices and tools for reproducible <font color=yellow>analysis<yellow>

## Research is complex

|  |  |
| ------:| -----|
| Single discipline   |  → Multiple disciplines |
| Single assay type |  → Multiple assay types |
| Single center    | → Multiple centers|
| GUI-driven analysis | → Script-driven analysis |

----

### Multi-disciplinary

- Cancer immunotherapy
  - Surgeon
  - Oncologist
  - Cancer biologist
  - Immunologist
  - Platform experts
  - Bioinformatician
  - Biostatistician

----

### Multiple complex assays

- Cancer immunotherapy
  - Whole exome or targeted sequencing for mutation load and neoantigens
  - RNA-seq for expression and pathway analysis
  - TCR sequencing for clonal diversity
  - Flow or mass cytometry for immunophenotyping and functional characterization
  - Multiplexed ELISA for cytokines, angiogenic factors, tumor growth factors
  - IHC for tumor architecture

----

### Multi-center studies

- May be necessary to get adequate power
  - Sample processing
  - Sample shipping
  - Reconciliation
  - Data standards and annotation

----


### Complex analysis pipelines

- Manual analysis is either already impossible or moving there rapidly
  - Whole exome sequencing: 180,000 exons or 3,000,000 base pairs
  - RNA-seq: 20,000 genes, millions of reads
  - TCR sequencing: possible TCRs > 10<sup>15</sup>
  - Cytometry: CyTOF and BD Symphony up to 50 parameters
  - Multiplexed ELISA: 10s - 100s of soluble factors
  - IHC: Up to 10 distinct antibodies
- Need for script-driven processing and analysis

## Reproducible Pieces

- Experimental design <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Data generation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Data stewardship <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> <font color=yellow>Data analysis<font><

---

### Experimental design

- Is there a statistical analysis plan? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Is there a sample management plan? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Is there a data management plan? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

----

### Statistical analysis

- What is the study objective?
- What is the outcome?
- What are the variables?
- What is the study design?
- Is there sufficient power?
- Will the samples be representative?
- <font color=yellow>Mock workflow often useful</font>

----

### Sample management

- Shipping SOP
- Transfer and reconciliation SOP
- Sample labeling
- Sample tracking
- Use of LIMS
- <font color=yellow>Mock workflow often useful</font>

----

### Data management

- Where will raw data be uploaded/stored?
- What variables will be recorded?
- What data standards will be used for annotation?
- Where will it be recorded?
- How are data entry errors handled?
  - Automated validation checks
  - Double-entry book-keeping
  - Review by supervisor
- Are data modifications tracked/logged?
- <font color=yellow>Mock workflow often useful</font>

---

### Data generation

- Instrument calibration <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Assay QA/QC/reproducibility <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Operator training <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Written SOPs essential <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

---

### Data stewardship

- FAIR principles to facilitate knowledge discovery
  - Findable
  - Accessible
  - Inter-operable
  - Reusable
- See [guidelines](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)

### Data re-analysis scenarios

- A reviewer wants to reproduce your results <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- A reader wants to reproduce your results <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Your study is chosen for a meta-analysis <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- You need to update the data <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- There is a bug in your script <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

---

### Can you reanalyze your data?

- Can you find and reuse the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Can you recreate the analysis environment? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Can you find and use the analysis scripts? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Can you replicate the report/poster/paper? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

----

### Can you find and reuse the data?

- Does the data even exist anymore?
- If exists, can you identify the exact data used?
- Can you link the laboratory and clinical data?

----

### Practices and tools (Data)

- Keep raw data
- Create hash data signatures
- Use standard vocabularies for annotation
- Use standard exchangeable formats
- Make a copy of all data
- Deposit in public repository
  - Genomic Data Commons
  - ImmPort

Example: [ReFlow](https://test.reflowproject.org)

----

### Can you recreate the environment?

- You used Windows XP <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Your lab is now a Mac-only shop <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- You used proprietary software A from Vendor X <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - Vendor X went bankrupt 2 years ago <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- You ran the analysis with R 3.1.2 with packages X (version A), Y (version B) and Z (version C)) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - Versions have been updated and are not compatible with R 3.1.2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

----

### Practices and tools (Environment)

- Prefer open-source tools
- Use reproducible environments

Example: Using Docker (Jeremy's talk)

----

### Can you use your analysis code?

-  Using a GUI (e.g. Excel), you needs perfect memory
  - Perfect memory does not exist
- Can you find the script(s) used for analysis?
- Are you 100% sure that is the script used?
- Dies your script still run? (see previous slide)

----

### Practices and tools (Code)

- Don't do the final analysis using a GUI
- Use version control for scripts (e.g. `hg`, `git`)
- Use a version control service (e.g. `GitHub`, `Bitbucket`')
- Commit early and often
- Use informative log messages when commuting

Example: Using [GitHub](https://github.com/cliburn/reproducible-analysis-2017)

----

### Can you re-generate the report/poster/paper?

- Can you replicate the report/poster/paper when
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->you need to modify some data
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->you need to fix a bug in your script
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->you want to try an alternative algorithm
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> <font color=yellow>If your report/poster/paper was done by copy/paste from Excel or Prism etc, you are most likely in for a world of pain</font>

----

### Practices and tools (Documents)

- Use a script for calculated values, tables and plots
- Practice literate programming
  - `knitr`
  - "Notebooks" - Jupyter, nteract, beaker, RStudio

Example: Literate programming with [notebooks](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Literate_Programming_Example.ipynb)
